# Restaurant-Management
ðŸ§¾ Project Description
This is a university project developed for the course "OOP and Databases Practicum". The application simulates a restaurant reservation system, where users can:
- Create and manage restaurants.
- Set the number of available seats.
- Book reservations for specific dates and number of guests.
The project uses the H2 database, which helped me better understand embedded databases and how to integrate them in Java-based applications. It also applies object-oriented programming principles and is a solid foundation for CRUD-based apps.

The goal was to build something both functional and practical, while learning more about back-end logic, database integration, and basic UI workflows.
